  <h2> About me!</h2>
  <p>My Name is Neema. I am 5 years old. I live in Africa, A wonderfull place to visit to see nature, wild animals, waterfalls, majestic mountains and many more. Did you know, the African continent is the world‚Äôs oldest populated area? My Favourite animal is the zebra, I like them because they have black and white stripes, They don't eat meat and because there are three species of zebra. A Gr√©vy's zebra, the largest and rarest of the three zebra species. My Favourite book is Cindarella, my favourite part was when Cindarella's God mother appeared to help her out.  </p>
